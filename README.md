# Hello, World!

## About Me
I'm a passionate Backend Developer from Poland, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Vistula University. 
When I'm not coding, you can find me spiking a volleyball or getting lost in immersive, story-rich video games.

I thrive on the challenges and complexities of distributed systems.
Go is my primary language of choice, known for its efficiency and reliability in backend development.
