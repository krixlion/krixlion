# Hello world!

## About me
I'm a Backend Developer from Poland, currently studying Computer Science at the Vistula University.\
Outside of programming I like playing volleyball and I enjoy a good story-rich video game.

I specialize in distributed systems and my primary language of choice is Go.

You can access all my open-source projects here on Github.
