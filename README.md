# Hello, World!

## About Me
I'm a Backend Developer from Poland, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Vistula University. 
Go is my primary language of choice. When I'm not coding, you can find me spiking a volleyball or getting lost in story-rich video games.

## Contact
I'm always open to networking and collaborations. You can reach out to me by pinging me on GitHub or connecting with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstanty-cyran).
